When I do go to watch a Chelsea game it's a massive day out we usually travel to London with a group of supporters by train. When we get to London we have some drinks in one of the supporter's pubs and walk to Stamford Bridge to watch the game.</p></div>

I played for my school for a few years, but most of my playing time was spent at Parley Football Club outside of school. I played in a few different positions but favored defense because my shooting accuracy was awful.</p></div>
