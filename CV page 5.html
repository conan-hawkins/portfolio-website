I have worked many jobs since leaving school from a cashier at KFC to a laborer on construction sites. My jobs have mostly been around the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole area with one exception. The Test Page 1 link below is to some of my early web development work. Look how much it's changed in a few short months. The hosting solution webpage is a comparison between different hosting options for my website.</p></div>

I like chicken and krushems from KFC in the 6 months I worked there I ate more than enough to make up for my ridiculously low wages. If it was possible for me to put on weight I would have been so fat after this job.</p></div>

            <div class="main_text"><p>Another job I did was working as a removal man for Maidens. I worked for Maidmans for about a year when I was given the opportunity to transfer to their parent company White and Company. I took this transfer because it opened up the possibility of working abroad and seeing more of the world, the pay increase also helped guarantee my move to the other company.</p></div>
