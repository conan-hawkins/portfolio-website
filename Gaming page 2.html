            <div class="main_text"><p>The first two consoles that introduced me to gaming were the Sony PlayStation 1 and the PlayStation 2. I played both of these consoles for many years and enjoyed them a lot, playing games such as Dragon Ball Z, Destroy All Humans and Call of Duty. When I was introduced to Halo 2 on the Xbox Original I fell in love with the game. This made me move away from PlayStation and buy Xbox for the next two generations of consoles. </p></div>

            <div class="main_text2"><p>It wouldn't be fair to talk about my early gaming experience without mentioning hand-held consoles. The picture of the pink GameBoy advanced SP belonged to my older sister when we were children my one was nearly identical in a slightly more boyish silver. Unfortunately, I lost my GameBoy many years ago however that was the perfect excuse to upgrade to my next hand-held console the Sony PSP. The Sony PSP was a huge upgrade to the GameBoy. It allowed me to play games on par with the PlayStation 2 instead of the arcade-type games available on the GameBoy.</p></div>

        <div class="content_container">
            <div class="main_text"><p>My favourite game of all time is a close contest between Halo 2 and Fallout New Vegas. Both games offer completely different things one is a level-based alien invasion shooter and the other is an open-world RPG set in a post-apocalyptic future. Halo 2 was first released in 2004 and Fallout New Vegas was released in 2009. I think this should say a lot about my opinion on the state of modern gaming.</p></div>

        <div class="content_container">
            <div class="main_text"><p>For me gaming is the thrill of overcoming challenges, the competitiveness of multiplayer, and the sheer escapism of single player games. Gaming isnâ€™t just about pixels on a screen; it's the rush of adrenaline I feel when I'm near to loosing a game but still manage to turn it around that keeps me comming back for more.</p></div>
