            <div class="main_text"><p>This website was created as a college project and is a collection of my personal hobbies, skills, and work experience. Most of the content on the website is tech based because it’s a subject that interests me a lot, but I also have a page about sport.</p></div>

            <div class="main_text"><p>I enjoy all kinds of games and gaming tech; you can find this content on the Gaming Page.</b></div>
            <div class="main_text2"><p>I love building and fixing general purpose computers including hardware and software; both will be included on the PC’s Page. My PC-building journey started on my family PC and progressed to high-end gaming machines in a few short years, mostly due to the amount of spare time I had during COVID-19.</p></div>

            <div class="main_text2"><p>Sport has always interested me. This includes playing and watching a wide variety of games. My favourite sport is football and I'm a massive Chelsea football club supporter! This is a little painful to admit because of their recent struggles but I'm sure they will do better next year. Find out more on the Sport Page.</p></div>

            <div class="main_text2"><p>The CV Page is a collection of my work experience and skills. It was included because I didn’t know what other page to add to the site so it might be a little boring. The picture of the red and white truck is from a removal company I used to work for a year before starting my college course. I liked the job because I got to travel all around the UK and it even took me to France, Spain and Portugal.</p></div>
