    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p> Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Butter two 20cm sandwich tins and line with non-stick baking paper.
        In a large bowl, beat 200g caster sugar, 200g softened butter, 4 beaten eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 tbsp milk together until you have a smooth, soft batter.
        Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth the surface with a spatula or the back of a spoon.
        Bake for about 20 mins until golden and the cake springs back when pressed.
        Turn onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely.
        To make the filling, beat the 100g softened butter until smooth and creamy, then gradually beat in 140g sifted icing sugar and a drop of vanilla extract (if youâ€™re using it).
        Spread the buttercream over the bottom of one of the sponges. Top it with 170g strawberry jam and sandwich the second sponge on top.
        Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. Keep in an airtight container and eat within 2 days.
