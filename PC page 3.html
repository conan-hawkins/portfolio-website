            <div class="main_text3"><p>My interest in computers began with gaming on my family's PC researching upgrades I could make to improve its gaming performance. About a year later, and with loads of new parts installed, I had built a computer with only a couple of the original components remaining. PC building was an enjoyable process, but it did not take me long to figure out that starting from scratch when building a PC is sometimes the better option. Now when upgrading a PC, I analyse the components and investigate future-proofing my machine to assess if it’s worthwhile. Making a mistake like that was my first big lesson in building PCs, but my years of experience make those mistake a rare occurrence now and I have had fun developing those skills. </p></div>

            <div class="main_text"><p>The RGB scam PC is £50 worth of obsolete PC components in a £40 RGB case with a £250 price tag! This scam is unfortunately far too common online and has taken over the used PC market. It targets people looking to buy a cheap PC with limited knowledge about computer hardware.</p></div>

        <div class="content_container">
            <div class="main_text"><p>The old Dell Office PC at £90 has better performance in every way when compared to the scam PC. However, the scam PC comes with a graphics card the GT 710. The GT 710 is a graphics card so old it belongs in a recycling center, not a gaming PC. I own a GT 710 and haven't used the thing in years it can be picked up for about £10 if you manage to navigate the scams still calling it a usable graphics card.</p></div>

            <div class="main_text"><p>Let's play a game called Find the Scam! Follow the attached link and look for any computer claiming to be a gaming PC with a GT 710 inside. Remember that the GT 710 was a questionable low-end graphics card at its release in 2014 so any PC using one now is an old piece of E-Waste.</p></div>
